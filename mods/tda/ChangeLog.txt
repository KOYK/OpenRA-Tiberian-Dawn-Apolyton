Added: Imported the full snow tileset from RA, you will ask why not do that for the rest of the tilesets? well have you ever notice why RA terrain color is so.. lets say cold? well if you take a look at the palettes, RA uses less colors for terrain, but TD uses more colors for terrain and that means TD terrain is more colorfull. Since snow comes from RA palette, even if you replace the palette with the TD one(using a program), you will still get an approximation with the same "less" colors, so its the same thing. I wonder why no one else have notice this, aside from me that is (yes I feel special leave me alone! XD)
