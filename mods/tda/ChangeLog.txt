160:
Engine: Update to release-20191117
Balance: Removed the adv.power plant research, and added per power plant upgrade (you select the power plant and then click the upgrade).

TDO even has bugs from the original, like the ability to sell infantry units close to sandbags. I will drop the coop support of the original missions from apolyton and add it for TDO, apolyton will still get coop missions but fresh new ones made for apolyton.
Fixed: Dead animation not showing some times when buildings die.
Balance: Faulty Fail Safe Chance for power plant decresed to 5 and 10 from 15 and 30
Added: Selection sound for power plants (I hope you like it it took me 5 min to make it :p)

Fixed: some palette data, nothing visual.
Added: 7 new dificulties for bots. Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Impossible, Nightmare
Added: 6 Missing Ford (crossing) tiles in temperat tileset, After painfully converting, cuting, color changing them one by one :'(
Added: A new Category for tiles that are being used as dummy tiles. The new Category name is: System (do Not Use).
Fixed: The following don't use terrain palette any more: Crates, ^TibTree, ^Wall, ^TechBuilding, ^DINO
Added: Imported the full snow tileset from RA, you will ask why not do that for the rest of the tilesets? well have you ever notice why RA terrain color is so.. lets say cold? well if you take a look at the palettes, RA uses less colors for terrain, but TD uses more colors for terrain and that means TD terrain is more colorfull. Since snow comes from RA palette, even if you replace the palette with the TD one(using a program), you will still get an approximation with the same "less" colors, so its the same thing. Not sure how many people know about this.
Added: Power down hotkey.
Balance: Oil Derrick no longer can be repaired after they are destroyed.
Balance: Oil Derrick now gives $500 and only to the first player who captures it.

Balance: Defences or Defenses are no longer capturable.
Added: You can sent supply trucks to enemy players by using ctrl and click.
Fixed: Updated repair\healing logic to a working contidion again.
Added: AI trained units will start with Rank based on thier dificulty, starting from AI Level 5

Rethink about the f22 minigun sound or if its a good idea to have a therd weapon for f22 at all.

Add chronosphere and iron curtain to the civilian faction (they will be allied friendly or ex soviet countries, so it will fit some how to the lore) (Requested by MegaTank C&C).

Add a minigun like laser weapon to (not yet added) miniguners when they get promoted maybe? (Requested by MegaTank C&C).

Add night vision\headlights to vehicles when its night (Requested by DrStrangelove).

Understand how tunnels work and add them for the map editor, also make a map with tunnels.

add pilot sounds during combat, like i did with the infantry
IMPORTANT: 
1) Add invisible (1 cell) production buildings for the AI to bring random units in, so I can bypass the LUA scripts that are needed for a task like this.
2) Add Campaign AI's.

add tiberium chem missile (using ra art for the silo, and recoloring the nuke missile) that will kill infantry, and drivers on tanks.
This will require a pilot\driver system that will allow for capturing the tanks.
this new weapon will replace the nuke.
I should add this weapon only to a new nod faction or not at all.
that new faction will have to be unique and focused on tech or something intresting, that also make sence.

add ability to destroy trees with force fire, like RA2.

also when tiberium gets close to a claster of trees they should transform into something else other than tib tree, maybe a TS vainhole.

Navy composition should be the following:

light 
medium
heavy
area lock down
stealth
defenive platforms
mines
oil rigs
