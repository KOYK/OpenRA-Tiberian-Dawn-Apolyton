Fixed: chem tower wrong tooltip after upgrade.

Added: new Dummy terrain in order for the Tiberium Growth Decelerator to work (tiberium trees change the terrain they stand on (1 square) in to dammy terrain automaticly, so the Tiberium Growth Decelerator can be placed on them by the player) Duct tape any one?

Added: New Building named Tiberium Growth Decelerator TGD for short, also known as Tiberium Spike. This new building will cover tiberium trees in order to Decelerate tiberium growth and give to the player a small money percentage of the tiberium. In order to enable it you will need to have "Turbo Tiberium" lobby otion set to ON.

Fixed: some palette problems of units that use RA palettes.

Added: new vehicle named mobile outpost vehicle, it can deploy in to an outpost, and only shows up in-game if lobby option "Outpost" is set to ON. Best used if "Limit Build Area" is set to ON aswell.

Added: new building named outpost, it gives buildable area.

Reworked: Some files and general infastracture of code (nothing worth explaining or in-game related), it was just a lot of work for me, so i had to mention it so i can feel better XD.

Reworked: tiberium economy! Now you can select in the lobby options what type of economy the game will be played. The lobby option is called "Turbo Tiberium" if you enable it you will also get the new TGD building (mentioned above) and also the tiberium will spreed faster in the map, and the harvesters are balanced for that too! If in the other hand you want the old way, you can just disable "Turbo Tiberium". And every one is happy!
oh boy all that work I put in this just to keep every one happy, the least you can do if you want to thank me, is to join my discord and tell me about any bugs you find. I am only one person, naturally ill miss some stuff.
