#unfortunally for some reason the idleoverlay palette messes with the building palette, and the end result is the building inheriting the idleoverlay palette. So i have to convert the buildings into one palette, but in a twist of fate i found that only the desert buildings are visually effected for my eyes, so i will change only them.
