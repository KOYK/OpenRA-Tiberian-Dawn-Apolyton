A Simple Advice From ELoyros.
Your Word Has Only Four Credentials In The Internet:
Your Work
Your Fame
Your Personality
And The Trust You Earned So Far.

The Work You Have Done Will Speak For You.
The Fame You Made Will Make People Notice You.
Your Personality Will Turn You Into A Likeable And Needed Person OR Someone Who All Dislike And Target.
And The Trust That Is Earned Or Lost Can Give You Great Oportunities Or Take Them Away.

Friends Are For The Powerful And Enemies Are For The Smallminded.
The Smallminded Seek For Power And The Powerful Own It.
