Unit xp
Hard to kill targets should give alot of xp (con yards, radars ect)
High hp targets should give alot of xp too (mammoth tank. obelisk)

Player xp
the player should be rewarded based on decicion making, so killing a 
defence, should not give alot of xp, but killing a high value target should give alot.
spies are not so hard to use and infiltrate so that should give some score but not too much.
team support should give more xp than spies for example.
